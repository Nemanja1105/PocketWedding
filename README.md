# PocketWedding
Pocket Wedding is a web application designed to make the wedding planning and organizing process efficient and straightforward. It will offer users a range of functionalities including tracking guest lists and RSVPs, seating arrangements, booking services, and a list of upcoming activities.
By using the Pocket Wedding app, all the important information about your wedding will be in one place, allowing you to plan and organize your wedding efficiently. All you need to do is use this system, and you can be confident that everything will run smoothly on one of the most important days of your life.

 <b>Pocket Wedding consists of three types of users: Administrator, Business Entity, and Client.</b>

<b>The Administrator</b>, like in any other system, will have the ability to modify data within the system, manage accounts registered in the system, resolve user issues, and review statistics. This includes viewing the number of jobs and earnings from established contracts on a monthly or annual basis for all business entities as well as for individual business entities or by categories of business entities. The Administrator can also view the locations from which the app's clients come. Additionally, the Administrator is responsible for defining and managing service categories. Multiple Administrators can be present in the system.

<b>The Business Entity</b> will have the ability to advertise and promote its services to clients, negotiate contracts, and review them. Furthermore, Business Entities will be able to view pending jobs. They can also review statistics related to the number of their own jobs and earnings from these jobs on a monthly or annual basis.

<b>The Client</b>, or the users for whom this app is primarily designed, will have the ability to oversee the entire wedding planning process. This includes reviewing wedding information, business entities, activities, contracts, guest lists, seating arrangements, profiles, and of course, managing these items. Clients can also recommend service categories to make searching more efficient and faster for other clients of the system.
